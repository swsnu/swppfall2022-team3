  - The user can see the profile detail of the sender by clicking the receiver’s main profile image.
  - The user can cancel a pitapat by clicking the pitapat button which is already toggled on.
- postconditions
  - After canceling a pitapat, the received user's profile is removed from the list.

    - when: when the user checks a sent Pitapat and presses the pitapat button to cancel
    - then: a received user is removed from the list, and the user is removed from the received pitapats list of the other user who just got canceled

### User Interface Requirements

Several changes on user interface requirements. The profile button got removed from the navigation bar and now it is at the top right corner. On the list of pitapats page, there are two tabs. One is the 'list of pitapats received' and the other is the 'list of pitapats sent'.
